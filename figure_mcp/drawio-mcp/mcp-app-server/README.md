# Draw.io MCP App Server

The MCP App server renders draw.io diagrams **inline** in AI chat interfaces using the [MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/extensions/apps) protocol. Instead of opening a browser tab, diagrams appear directly in the conversation as interactive iframes.

## How It Works

1. The LLM calls the `create_diagram` tool with draw.io XML
2. The host fetches the UI resource and renders it in a sandboxed iframe
3. The diagram is rendered using the official [draw.io viewer](https://viewer.diagrams.net)
4. The user sees an interactive diagram inline with zoom, pan, and layers support

## Tool: `create_diagram`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `xml` | string | One of `xml` / `mermaid` | draw.io XML in mxGraphModel format. Mutually exclusive with `mermaid`. |
| `mermaid` | string | One of `xml` / `mermaid` | Mermaid.js diagram definition (26 supported diagram types — flowchart, sequence, class, state, ER, gantt, mindmap, timeline, quadrant, C4, architecture, …). Parsed and laid out natively, then converted to draw.io. Mutually exclusive with `xml`. |
| `postLayout` | enum | No | Optional ELK layered-flow pass applied after render. Only value: `"elk"`. Vertex positions are replaced; only edge topology survives. |
| `direction` | enum | No | XML-only flow direction for `postLayout: "elk"`: `"vertical"` (default) or `"horizontal"`. Ignored for Mermaid (direction comes from the `flowchart TD/LR` code). |

Provide exactly one of `xml` or `mermaid` as a plain string — not an object or array.

The rendered diagram includes:
- Interactive zoom, pan, and navigation
- Layer toggling and lightbox mode
- "Open in draw.io" button to edit the diagram in the full editor
- Fullscreen mode

## Official Hosted Endpoint

The official draw.io MCP App server is hosted at:

```
https://mcp.draw.io/mcp
```

Add this URL as a remote MCP server in Claude.ai, Cursor, or any MCP Apps-compatible host — no installation or setup required.

> **Note:** This server renders diagrams **inline** via the [MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/extensions/apps) protocol, so it requires an MCP Apps–capable host (e.g. Claude.ai or Cursor). In hosts that don't support MCP Apps — such as **VS Code / GitHub Copilot** or Claude Code — the tool connects but has nothing to render, so the diagram won't appear. For those clients use the stdio [`@drawio/mcp`](../mcp-tool-server) tool server instead, which opens diagrams in the browser. ChatGPT isn't supported yet: its connectors are remote-only and use OpenAI's own widget format rather than MCP Apps, so the diagram won't render inline — and unlike the editors above, the stdio fallback can't be used.

### Using with Cursor

Cursor supports the MCP Apps extension (Cursor **≥ 2.6**), so diagrams render inline in the Agent chat. On older builds the server still connects, but there's nothing to render inline; use the stdio [`@drawio/mcp`](../mcp-tool-server) tool server instead, which opens diagrams in the browser.

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=drawio&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL21jcC5kcmF3LmlvL21jcCJ9)

Click the button above for one-click install, or add the hosted endpoint manually to `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global) or `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "drawio": {
      "url": "https://mcp.draw.io/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Enable the server when prompted (or under **Cursor Settings → MCP**), then ask the Agent to create a diagram.

## Self-Hosting

If you prefer to run your own instance, you can use Node.js or deploy to Cloudflare Workers.

### Installation

```bash
cd mcp-app-server
npm install
```

### Running (Node.js)

Start the HTTP server (for Claude.ai and other web-based hosts):

```bash
npm start
```

The server listens on `http://localhost:3001/mcp` by default. Set the `PORT` environment variable to change the port.

### Connecting to Claude.ai

Since Claude.ai needs a public URL, use a tunnel:

```bash
npx cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3001
```

Then add the tunnel URL (with `/mcp` appended) as a custom connector in Claude.ai settings.

### Using with Claude Desktop (stdio)

Add to your Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "drawio-app": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/mcp-app-server/src/index.js", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Inline diagram rendering requires an MCP host that supports the MCP Apps extension. In hosts without MCP Apps support, the tool still works but returns the XML as text.

## Deploying to Cloudflare Workers

The server can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers for a public endpoint without tunnels.

### Prerequisites

- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- Node.js 18+

### Deploy

```bash
npm install
npx wrangler login        # One-time: authenticate with Cloudflare
npm run deploy             # Build + deploy to Workers
```

The deploy script runs `node src/build-html.js` (pre-inlines the SDK bundles into the HTML) then `wrangler deploy`.

### Local development with Wrangler

```bash
npm run dev:worker
```

This starts a local Workers dev server at `http://localhost:8787/mcp`.

### How the Worker entry differs from Node.js

| | Node.js (`src/index.js`) | Worker (`src/worker.js`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Transport** | `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` (Express) | `WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport` (Web Standard `Request`/`Response`) |
| **HTML build** | Reads bundles from `node_modules` at startup | Pre-built at deploy time via `src/build-html.js` → `src/generated-html.js` |
| **Schema validation** | Default (Zod-based) | Default (Zod-based) |

## Publishing to the MCP Registry

The hosted server is listed in the [MCP Community Registry](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry) as **`io.draw/mcp`**, defined by [`server.json`](server.json) in this directory. The community registry feeds downstream surfaces such as [GitHub's MCP Registry](https://github.com/mcp) and VS Code's *MCP: Browse Servers* (GitHub additionally curates what it features on its own page).

**One-time setup** — prove ownership of the `draw.io` domain. Generate a keypair (macOS's system LibreSSL lacks Ed25519 — use Homebrew OpenSSL 3) and publish the public key as a DNS TXT record:

```bash
brew install mcp-publisher openssl@3
OPENSSL=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/bin/openssl
$OPENSSL genpkey -algorithm Ed25519 -out ~/.drawio-mcp-registry-key.pem
echo "draw.io. IN TXT \"v=MCPv1; k=ed25519; p=$($OPENSSL pkey -in ~/.drawio-mcp-registry-key.pem -pubout -outform DER | tail -c 32 | base64)\""
```

Add the printed TXT record on the **apex** of `draw.io` (record name `@` in Cloudflare DNS — not under a selector like `_mcp-auth`, which the registry will not see). Keep the key file for future publishes, and keep it outside the repository; losing it only means generating a new key and replacing the TXT record (remove the stale record — leftovers are tried first and break verification).

**Publish / update** — bump `version` in `server.json` first (kept in lockstep with `package.json`), then from this directory:

```bash
OPENSSL=/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/bin/openssl
mcp-publisher login dns --domain draw.io --private-key "$($OPENSSL pkey -in ~/.drawio-mcp-registry-key.pem -noout -text | grep -A3 'priv:' | tail -n +2 | tr -d ' :\n')"
mcp-publisher publish
```

The `io.draw` namespace is the reverse-DNS form of the verified `draw.io` domain (the same pattern as the registry's own `io.modelcontextprotocol/everything`). The alternative would be `io.github.jgraph/...` via `mcp-publisher login github`, but that requires jgraph org-owner rights and gives up the brand naming.

## Architecture

### File layout

```
src/
  shared.js          Shared logic: buildHtml(), processAppBundle(), createServer()
  index.js           Node.js entry (Express + stdio transports)
  worker.js          Cloudflare Workers entry (Web Standard fetch handler)
  build-html.js      Build script: generates generated-html.js + xml reference
  generated-html.js  (gitignored) Pre-built HTML string + XML reference for the Worker
wrangler.toml        Wrangler configuration
../shared/
  xml-reference.md   Shared XML generation reference (single source of truth)
```

The `create_diagram` tool description is loaded from `shared/xml-reference.md` at startup (Node.js) or pre-built into `generated-html.js` at deploy time (Workers). This file is the single source of truth for XML generation guidance across all four approaches in the repository.

### How the HTML is built

The server inlines two bundles into a self-contained HTML string:

- **`app-with-deps.js`** (~319 KB) — MCP Apps SDK browser bundle from `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`. The bundle is ESM (ends with `export { ... as App }`), so the server strips the export statement and creates a local `var App = <minifiedName>` alias. This makes it safe to inline in a plain `<script>` tag inside the sandboxed iframe.
- **`pako_deflate.min.js`** (~28 KB) — for compressing XML into the `#create=` URL format.

Both are inlined into the HTML served via `registerAppResource`. The draw.io viewer (`viewer-static.min.js`) is loaded from CDN at runtime.

For **Node.js**, this happens at startup (bundles read from `node_modules` via `fs`). For **Workers**, the `build-html.js` script does this at build time and writes `generated-html.js`.

### Key constraints

- The MCP Apps sandbox uses `sandbox="allow-scripts"` but **not** `allow-same-origin`, so Blob URL module imports fail silently. That's why the ESM export statement is stripped and a plain `var` alias is created.
- `app.openLink()` must be used instead of `<a target="_blank">` since the sandbox doesn't have `allow-popups`.
- `GraphViewer.processElements()` requires the container to have a nonzero `offsetWidth`, hence the `min-width: 200px` on `#diagram-container`.
